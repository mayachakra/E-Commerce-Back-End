# E-Commerce Back End | ORM (Object-Related-Mapping)

## User Story
```
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```
## Acceptance Criteria
This site follows the acceptance criteria of:
```
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, PostgreSQL username, and PostgreSQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the PostgreSQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```

## Description
For this assignment I created the back end for an e-commerce site which takes a working Express.js API and used Sequelize to interact with the PostgreSQL database. 
I worked on the filling in the database Models, the associations for the Models, and filling out the API Routes to perform CRUD operations. To do this I ran the database,
ran the seed, and deployed the server and tested it through Insomnia.

## Deployment
